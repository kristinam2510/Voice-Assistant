1. Purpose
Your assistant is a voice-enabled AI assistant. It can:
Listen to your input (or take text input).
Process it (usually with some AI model like an LLM).
Respond via speech, using a voice you select.
Itâ€™s essentially a talking chatbot.

2. Components
voices.py
This file defines the voice your assistant uses.
Example: You can choose a male or female voice, or a specific TTS engine voice ID.
Changing the voice only requires editing this file, without touching the main assistant logic.
voice_assistant.py
This is the main program.
It handles:
Receiving input from you (text or speech).
Generating a response (usually via an AI or pre-defined rules).
Sending the response to the TTS engine to speak it out loud using the voice from voices.py.
Essentially, this is the brain of your assistant.

3. How it Works
You type or speak something.
voice_assistant.py receives your input.
The assistant generates a response (AI or pre-programmed).
It calls a TTS function, which uses the voice selected in voices.py.
The assistant speaks the response aloud.
